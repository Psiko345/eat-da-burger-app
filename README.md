## Overview

- Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

- Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

- Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

- This app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

- NOTE: Although it isn't very realistic, a user may also 'un-devour' a burger, This is due to me wanting to figure out how to toggle a boolean in the SQL database.

## Installation

- To install, simply run `npm install`

## Features

- MVC file structure
- Homemade ORM
- MySQL database with CRUD capabilities
